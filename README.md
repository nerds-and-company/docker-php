# itmundi/php
Itmundi PHP image for Docker
This container extends the `itmundi/php-base` container. See for more information that container.

This container does not contain additional items that are not present in the base container,
except for some `ONBUILD` statements. Since these statements are present, it is not possible
to extend this container in other automated builds.
